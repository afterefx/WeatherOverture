## :scroll: Description
A weather app that will show the current weather and a 7 day forecast for any give zip code or city name.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
* I was motivated by [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/15321987-Weather-App-Night-Beyond-Neumorphism) that I found on dribble. Thanks to [Jochang](https://lottiefiles.com/user/26177) at 
lottiefiles for creating the lottie animated assets. 
* I'm proud of a couple things in this app: 
    1. This app calls the OpenWeatherMap API 
    2. The app is setup in an MVI model using Kotlin Flow and Channels. 
    3. The gradient background for the app and the bottom card took a bit of time
    4. The infinite animation of clouds for the loading screen turned out to be easier than expected.
